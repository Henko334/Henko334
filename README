# Hi, I'm Henko

I’m a software developer with just over 4 years of professional experience.
Most of the projects here are personal projects built for fun and learning.

## 🛠 Interests
I enjoy working with:
Arduino
Raspberry Pi
Hardware + software integrations
APIs and backend systems
Desktop applications (WPF)
Most Raspberry Pi projects are written in Python, and I also build applications in C#, primarily using WPF.

## 🌦 Favourite Project – Weather Station
My favourite project is my Weather Station system.

It consists of:
A Raspberry Pi collecting sensor data (Python)
A custom API to store data in a local database
A C# WPF desktop application to visualize the data
This project required three separate codebases running on three different devices, all communicating together.
It’s a fairly simple system, but it successfully achieved what I set out to build and was a great learning experience in system integration.

## 🖨 InkSystem
Another project I enjoyed building was InkSystem.
I created this while working as an IT Technician at a local school.
The goal was to track printer toner usage across different areas of the school.

Backend: MS Access database

Desktop app: C#
This was my first real-world coding project before becoming a full-time software developer.

## 💻 Other Work
I’ve also built:
WPF applications (as a step up from WinForms)
Various C# utilities
Python projects for Raspberry Pi automation
I enjoy learning by building practical tools and experimenting with hardware + software combinations.
